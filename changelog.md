  * Bug fix: Current view unnecessarily reloading data.
* 0.6.0

  * Enhancement: Scope-build on Visualizer page.  Allows user to set up input Map to be used for Visualizer display.
  * Enhancement: Visualize n-cube as connected network (graphs)
  * Enhancement: Reference Axis support.  Cube axes can now point to 'reference' or 'definitional axes' so that if the referred to axis is modified, so to is the referring axis (data is not duplicated).
  * Enhancement: Filter rows
  * Enhancement: Single cube commit, update, and compare
  * Enhancement: Tabs can be drag-n-dropped rearranged
  * Enhancement: cut / copy / paste now copy cells exact (e.g. GroovyExpression is not turned into a String).  Also, if the content to be copied contains newlines or quotes, that is handled properly as well.
  * Enhancement: In order to copy from NCE to Excel, you can toggle the clipboard mode (Ctrl-K or Cmd-K on macs).  This will toggle the copy mode.  When toggle, the information on the clipboard with either be copied in NCE mode (with extra information about the cell type - maintains cell type) or in Excel mode (compatible with pasting into Excel).

  * Enhancement: Multiple n-cubes (tabs) open
  * Enhancement: Revision history - Compare, Promote
  * Enhancement: Search (find) within columns / cells
* 0.4.0
  * 10x speed up in loading the cube HTML.  No longer sending String return values to resolveRefs (5x) and adding single listener to table instead of a listener-per-cell (5x).
  * Enhancement: 'Processing...' (toast) messages pop up now for menu items that generally take a bit of time to execute.  This allows the menu click to be processed, the 'toast' to be displayed, and then the toast clears and the appropriate modal displays. 
  * Bug fix: NPE was occuring when scanning GroovyTemplate cells (that were empty) for cube name references (invoked from 'Show Inbound References' menu).  Fixed.
  * Bug fix: NPE was occurring on the back-end because the front-end was allowing "" for column values which is illegal. Fixed.  
  * Bug fix: Update branch 'accept mine' was merging the branch cube into HEAD.  Instead it should have updated the headSha1 of the branch cube to match the HEAD cube so that it was prepared-to-overwrite when committed.
  * Bug fix: When there is no cube in the HEAD and cube is created/deleted/restored, it was throwing an error.  Instead, this should be treated as a create to HEAD on commit.
  * Bug fix: When duplicating an n-cube, there was an error being displayed about NCE unable to call getAppNames(), caused by parameter mismatch in Ajax function call. Fixed.
  * Clean up: When you switch applications, versions, or branch, the menu is rebuilt, because sys.menu may be different per anyone of these selectors. 
  * Clean up: All tabs now have intelligent displays when there are 0 cubes available in the selected App.
  * Fancy splash screen logo added to application start-up.
* 0.3.0
  * Update Branch - Before it was operating transactionally, meaning that no cubes were updated if there were any merge conflict.  Now, Update branch makes all possible updates (commits them) and then shows the number of updates, merges, and conflicts.  If there are any conflicts, a merge conflict window will pop-up to allow the conflict to be resolved.
  * Search now only searches locally in memory unless the 'contains' field has content.  This dramatically speeds up search and reduces a lot of database server load.
  * Search now illustrates the selected text in the drop down even when a wildcard ('*') is used.
  * Rule names - now display much nicer (charms) and without the 'name:' text.
  * Rule conditions - user can now enter `url|` or `cache|` in front of the rule condition to indicate that the expression should be cached (or from a URL).  Both can be used, or either one, or no prefix.
  * Link highlight / substitution - the algorithm that matches the cube names within the cube cells now finds the longer cube names before the shorter cube names. It also handles multiple in a cell.  The algorithm no longer attempts substitutions in URLs, which was rendering the URL unable to be clicked and followed.
  * Cube HTML is loaded faster using `innerHTML` instead of JQuery HTML (loads cube HTML twice as fast).  Similarly, where possible, `.textContent` is used as it is nearly 20x faster than JQuery's `.html()` or `.text()`.
  * Default cell values are now displayed (in light gray) so that you can easily tell when a cell will pickup the n-cube level default.
  * The default cell can now be completely set from the 'Details' page (`GroovyExpression`, `String`, `Template`, ... all data types and linked types).
  * The back-button now recognizes when the app, version, status, and branch have not change, and simply selects the desired cube (rather than reload cubes for the changed app, version, etc.).  This makes the normal back-button use-case much faster.
  * 'Loading...' is now displayed when the application is starting.
  * Test tab styles updated to match the rest of the application.
  * Test inputs can now be `GroovyExpressions` or `Groovy Templates` (any `CommandCell`).
  * Application and Versions list now use single `bootstrap-select` widget so that they use much less vertical screen space, allowing more n-cubes to show.
  * Updated to n-cube 3.3.9
  * Updated to Twitter Bootstrap 3.3.5
  * Updated to JQuery 2.1.4.
  * New logo image.
  * Added favicon.ico
* 0.2.0
  * Updated to use n-cube 3.3.3 (using new search API)
  * Added HTML / JSON / Compare buttons to the Revision History screen
* 0.1.0
  * Initial version
